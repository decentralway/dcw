DecentralWay Core V.1.1
===============================

What is DecentralWay?
----------------

Our technology plays first and foremost on making real data publicly but at the same time anonymously and securely accessible on our blockchain. Application examples such as the decentralized storage of distances for insurance companies, the electricity consumption of individual households for electricity providers, are only a minimal part of the possibilities of our smart-side-chain technology.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the DecentralWay Core software, see https://decentralway.com/#about
